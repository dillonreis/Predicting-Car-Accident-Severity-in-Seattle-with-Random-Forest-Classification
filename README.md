# Predicting-Car-Accident-Severity-in-Seattle-with-Random-Forest-Classification
Analysis and modeling of car accident severity data in Seattle.
Performed data cleaning, analysis, and balancing while identifying what
features help explain what makes an accident severe (major injuries or death) and
non-severe (property damage or minor injuries) in the city of Seattle. Developed a
circle marker map to help show significant locations and streets. Engineered features,
searched for significant features, optimized hyperparameters, and evaluated the model's
metrics and learning curve. Detailed suggestions on what can be done to avoid severe accidents are included.
